# forest-kingdom
Game built using the pygame library. 

## Inspiration

I've always wanted to build an avatar the last airbender -based rpg. 
I'd like to add bending attacks and create a world based in the avatar universe.

Initially I think I'll start with inspiration from the Forest Kingdom area in Nier Automata, and move on from there.

## Notes
